## Greetr Library

Just a little library created to deepen my javascript understanding.
Very basic, built whilst following the "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts" course on Udemy.
Great course which really dives under the hood of JS, which makes understanding
what goes on on the surface a lot easier. Great for improving your debugging skills.
